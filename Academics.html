                        <h3>My School Academics</h3>
                        <p>I have done my primary schooling at Blue Bells and higher studies from the D.B.M.S English School. Scoring 96.6% in my ICSE board was a huge achievement for me as it gave me the much needed confidence to apply for IIT JEE. I received a plaque for getting the highest score in my school for Mathematics and Science. I was never a scholar as a kid and therefore had to work hard to maintain my pointers in the ISC board. But my hard work paid off and I passed with 94.6%.  </p>

                    <h3>The JEE Journey</h3>
                        <p>Having finished my 10th grade with flying colour, I joined the PRERNA Classes in order to fulfill
                        my dream of studying in an IIT. Learning from the motivated teachers( IITians themselves ) helped me stay 
                        focussed throughout those two years. Ultimately the efforts and hardwork paid off as I got admission into
                        one of the prestigious colleges of India, IIT Kharagpur.   </p>

                    <h3>IIT Kharagpur</h3>
                        <p>One of the biggest campus in India, IIT Kgp offers a wide range of options to its students. The different
                        societies, sports, festivals, technology, Hall culture, etc. encourages its students to persue any field that
                        suits their interests. For our first year we are having the same subjects irrespective of the department. I 
                        managed to score 8.52 cgpa in the first physics semester. However, the second semester was interrupted due 
                        to a serious medical emergency, the COVID-19 which has proven to be a world pandemic.
